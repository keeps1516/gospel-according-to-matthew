# A Study On The Gospel of Matthew

## Introduction

- 1:1-17
  - God is accomplishing his plan through the faithfulness and despite the faithlessness of his people.
  - Key Doctrines: Providence, Christology
  - Thesis: Jesus, the climax of history.
  - Genesis of Jesus.
    - The very first verse of this Gospel leads the reader to suspect that the OT will play an important role in it: “A book of the genesis of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham” (1:1). The phrase biblos geneseōs may echo the Greek name for the first book of the Bible (Genesis) or be translated “genealogy,” introducing 1:2–17 and reflecting the frequent scriptural use of records of ancestors to demonstrate one’s pedigree (for the identical phrase, see Gen. 2:4; 5:1 in the LXX). [^1]
    - The first two words of Matthew’s gospel are literally “Book of genesis” (see note 1 above).8 The effect on a Jewish reader is comparable to that of John’s opening phrase, “In the beginning …” The theme of the fulfillment of Scripture is signaled from the very start, and these opening words suggest that a new creation is now taking place. [^2]
    - Jesus’ genealogy selects just enough ancestors (“begat” can mean “was the ancestor of”) to create three series of fourteen names, probably employing gematria (the numerical value of the sum of the Hebrew consonants of a given word) on the name דוד (“David”), which equaled fourteen (ד = 4, ו = 6, ד = 4). [^3]
    - The echo of Genesis in the first two words, Βίβλος γενέσεως, the evocative title Χριστός which follows immediately, the repeated names of Abraham and David, the way the subsequent list follows the royal line of Judah, and is structured around the key turning-points of the beginning and end of the actual monarchy of Judah (a point drawn out rather pedantically in v 17. for the sake of any who may have missed it!), all these make Matthew's purpose plain, and the neat (if artificial) symmetry drawn out in v. 17 conveys the impression that all that has gone before adds up to a rounded era of history, to which Jesus comes as the due culmination.[^4]
    - Application Questions: 
      - Since all of history is His story, will God use you because of your obedience to him or inspite of it?
      - When history has been rolled up like a scroll and our part in God's story has been played out, what things will
