## Rehoboam

Biblical Narrative
Rehoboam’s narrative appears in 1 Kgs 12–14 and 2 Chr 10–12.

Rehoboam in Kings
- Rehoboam ascended the throne after the death of his father, King Solomon (1 Kgs 11:43b) and traveled to Shechem (1 Kgs 12), an area that was the center of Israelite tradition from the time of Joshua (Josh 24) and the judges (Judg 9).
Rather than accepting Rehoboam automatically, the northern leaders negotiated for less strenuous labor demands and lower taxes (1 Kgs 12:4). In response to their request, Rehoboam sought advice from two groups of counselors: experienced elders and young contemporaries with whom he had consorted all his life. The elders advised Rehoboam to act favorably toward the people and in turn receive their favor (1 Kgs 12:7). In contrast, the young contemporaries advised Rehoboam to assert his control by increasing the workload (1 Kgs 12:10–11). Rehoboam chose to follow the young advisors; as a result, he angered the northern messengers (1 Kgs 12:13–14). First Kings 12:15 explains that Rehoboam acted this way because God was using him to fulfill the prophecy delivered by Ahijah the prophet (1 Kgs 11:29–39), which promised that the northern tribes would be removed from Davidic rule.
The northern tribes declared their freedom from the Davidic line of kings (1 Kgs 12:16). From that point on, north and south represented two distinct kingdoms. Rehoboam made one last effort to control the north by asking Adoram, the chief of the labor gangs, to put the northern tribes back to work for him; however, when Israel killed Adoram, Rehoboam fled south (1 Kgs 12:17–19). Israel then named Jeroboam king over the north (1 Kgs 12:20). Rehoboam collected his forces and those of the tribe of Benjamin and prepared to launch war against the north (1 Kgs 12:21). However, he halted when Shemaiah the prophet stated that God had caused the division (1 Kgs 12:23–24). This, however, was a rare instance in which Rehoboam obeyed God. The text indicates that he built worship places and allowed cultic prostitution for foreign gods (1 Kgs 14:22–24).
During Rehoboam’s reign, Pharaoh Shishak marched north from Egypt and attacked Jerusalem, ransacking the temple and taking all of its treasures—including the gold shields put there by Solomon. First Kings 14:27 records that Rehoboam crafted shields of bronze to replace the gold ones. Rehoboam died after reigning for 17 years.

Rehoboam in Chronicles
- Second Chronicles 10–12 offers several more details about Rehoboam’s life. The text specifies that some northerners lived in the south and served King Rehoboam (2 Chr 10:17). It also indicates that Rehoboam strengthened the fortifications of 15 cities in Judah and Benjamin, the two tribes he controlled. Deprived of priestly privileges and duties in the north, Levites and priests fled southward. Many others joined the stream of people flowing south. Chronicles indicates that Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60 concubines, and fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters.
Second Chronicles records that Rehoboam and the people’s disobedience to God brought about the invasion of Shishak, who captured Judah’s fortified cities. Shemaiah the prophet interpreted Shishak’s destructive invasion as God’s work against a people who had abandoned Him. When Rehoboam and his people humbled themselves, God reduced His sentence to a “little deliverance” (2 Chr 12:7 HCSB). Shishak took Jerusalem and its treasures.

Rehoboam and Shishak
- Archaeological finds affirm that Shishak existed and invaded Palestine. However, none of the documentary finds associated with Shishak mention Jeroboam, Rehoboam, any city in Judah, or even Israel or Judah. Provan, Long, and Longman (A History of Israel, 262) state that the identification of “Shishak” is uncertain. “Interpretative challenges regarding both the inscriptions and the biblical texts leave some room for doubt about the identification of the pharaoh and about the correlation of the biblical text with the inscriptions.” The uncertainty of Pharaoh’s identification and of the purpose and direction of the expedition make it impossible to make historical judgments.
Kitchen concludes, “Beyond rational doubt, these Egyptian data give us direct evidence that links up with the event mentioned under Rehoboam in Kings and Chronicles” (Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament, 10). His dates for Shosenq (circa 945–924) fit Shishak’s (circa 931–914). Kitchen does not expect a mention of Jeroboam, Rehoboam, Israel, or Judah, identifying “that was never done in such long town lists” (Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament, 34). In addition, he identifies 98 names on Shosenq’s list that are not found on any other lists, thus breaking down a theory of copying from lists of earlier kings (Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament, 496). [^1]

## Abijah
 The son of Rehoboam and second king of the southern kingdom of Judah (1 Kgs 14:31–15:8; 2 Chr 13:1–14:1); also referred to as Abijam (1 Kgs 14:31).
Abijah reigned for three years in Judah (ca. 913–911 BC) as an evil king who “committed all the sins his father had done before him” (1 Kgs 15:3 NIV), which included many idolatrous acts. There was constant conflict and war between Judah and Jeroboam and the northern kingdom of Israel during his reign (1 Kgs 15:7; 2 Chr 13:2). Abijah seems to have had some military savvy and led a few successful military campaigns (2 Chr 8:1–22). Abijah had 14 wives who bore him 22 sons and 16 daughters (2 Chr 13:21).
The account in 2 Chronicles speaks more positively about Abijah. In both accounts, both Rehoboam and Abijah were appointed by God in order to fulfill His promise to David that his line would continue to rule in Jerusalem (1 Kgs 15:4). According to Kaiser, “This is because the promise made to David was based on an unconditional covenant and was unilateral; it did not depend on how faithfully the house of David lived their lives” (Kaiser, A History of Israel, 309). The blessing applied to Abijah’s reign was, therefore, the result of God’s grace and covenant, not the merit of the king himself (House, 1, 2 Kings, 196).
Abijah’s mother was Maacah, who was the daughter of Abishalom (1 Kgs 15:2), also referred to as Absalom (2 Chr 11:20).[^2]
